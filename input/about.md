Hi, my name is Matteo.

I am a software engineer based in Bern, Switzerland. I work in a medium size company and focus on developing business web applications using .NET technologies like ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core and some client frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery. I am a tech enthusiast and I really like to try out the newest ASP.NET Core stuff and share my learnings with the community.

Next to my techie side I love to go out into the mountains and have fun while hiking and especially while Paragliding. Next to all that I have some private projects that I work on during the rainy days or those nights that I can't sleep.

If you like my blog drop a comment or support me with a coffee to keep me going.
