This blog post is a continuation of [Damien's](https://damienbod.com/2021/04/05/creating-verifiable-credentials-in-asp-net-core-for-decentralized-identities-using-trinsic/) blog post about the creation of verifiable credentials. In his blog post Damien showed how to set up an ASP.NET Core application to obtain a credential from the Trinsic platform. In this part we are going to look at how we can Verify these credentials in order to continue some sort of business process. We will continue with the sample that Damien started and after obtaining our driver license we want to buy an insurance. The insurance company wants us to verify that we have obtained proper credentials.
