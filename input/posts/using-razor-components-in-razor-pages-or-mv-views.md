I am a big fan of Razor Pages and in my opinion Razor Pages is one of the best programming model to get started in the ASP.NET Core world. [Blazor](https://blazor.net) is the new kid on the block and no doubt I do like the way Blazor (Client-Side) is being developed. But it is still in preview and therefore no where close of being used in production. Blazor Server-Side has been shipped with ASP.NET Core 3.0 and could be used but in my opinion Blazor Server-Side is not a programming model I do want to build an app on. But this is my opinion and others might think different which is okay. But with all this also Razor Components have been introduced and in this blog post I want to show how you can use Razor Components in your Razor Pages or MVC Application.
