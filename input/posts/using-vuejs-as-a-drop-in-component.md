In this blog post I wanted to share how I am using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a "drop in" component on a razor page. By drop in component I mean that I use Vue.js only for client side model binding. This is similar to how we used to use Knockout.JS in ASP.NET MVC applications. I will not explain what Vue.js is or what it does behind the scenes, I will show how I used Vue.js to create a paged list.

### Why Vue.js?

I am not a very big fan of the SPA Frameworks like Angular or React and also in fact I am not a big fan of Vue.js for building full client side applications. In my opinion a server rendered page created with Razor Pages can be built faster with less overhead and with a smaller chance of creating security issues. Never the less Vue.js is a great extension to such pages as it has great [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and it is very simple to get it running on just a single page where required.
